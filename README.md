# Android Arch annotation processor

### What?
This library aims to reduce boilerplate in projects based upon our architecture.
The project consists of annotations, used to mark injectable activities and
fragments, as well as viewmodels.

The annotation processor will generate a dagger module, which can be included in
your app component.
